# CI/CD Workflow Architecture

This document describes the complete GitHub Actions CI/CD system for the kanban-app project.
<!-- auto-merge validation: 2026-02-14 -->

---

## Overview

The system consists of **6 workflow files** covering the full lifecycle from push to auto-merge.

```
Every push to main/dev
  └── ci.yml                    (build check only)

Every PR targeting main (non-draft)
  ├── pr-validation.yml         (lint, build, tests, coverage)
  ├── security-performance.yml  (secrets, SAST, bundle size)
  ├── dependency-review.yml     (CVEs, license compliance)
  └── docker-validation.yml     (Docker build + health, path-filtered)

When any of the above complete
  └── auto-merge.yml            (squash merge if all required checks pass)
```

---

## Workflow Details

### 1. `ci.yml` — CI (Build Check)

**Trigger:** Push or PR to `main` or `dev`
**Purpose:** Lightweight baseline check that runs on every push, including to the `dev` branch where PR-specific workflows don't apply.

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Checkout | `actions/checkout@v4` |
| Node setup | Node 24, npm cache |
| Install | `npm ci` |
| Build | `npm run build` with `VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=ci-dummy-key` |

**Note:** No test suite here — full testing is handled by `pr-validation.yml`. This workflow just confirms the Vite build doesn't break.

---

### 2. `pr-validation.yml` — PR Validation

**Trigger:** PR opened/synchronized/reopened/ready-for-review targeting `main`
**Skip condition:** Draft PRs (`github.event.pull_request.draft == false`)
**Concurrency:** One run per PR, cancels in-progress runs on new pushes

#### Job 1 — Quick Checks (timeout: 5m)

Runs in parallel with Job 2.

| Step | Command |
|------|---------|
| Lint | `npm run lint` |
| Build | `npm run build` (VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=ci-dummy-key) |

#### Job 2 — Database & API Tests (timeout: 10m)

Spins up a real `postgres:17-alpine` service container.

**Database setup sequence:**
1. Create `app_user` (non-superuser) — required so RLS policies are actually enforced
2. Run schema migrations: `npx drizzle-kit push --config=server/drizzle.config.js --force`
3. Grant `app_user` table-level permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE + sequences)
4. Apply RLS policies: `node server/db/apply-rls.js`

**Why two DB users?**
PostgreSQL superusers bypass RLS by default. Tests connect as `app_user` (non-superuser) so RLS is enforced. Migrations run as `postgres` (superuser) via `ADMIN_DATABASE_URL`.

**Test execution:**
- Vitest suite: `npm run test:coverage` (connects as `app_user`)
- RLS tests: `node --test server/tests/test-rls.js` (uses Node's native `node:test`, NOT vitest)

Both steps use `set +e` to capture exit codes without immediately failing, so both always run and their results are reported together.

**Coverage parsing:**
Reads `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (generated by `@vitest/coverage-v8` with the `json-summary` reporter) and extracts lines, statements, functions, and branches percentages.

**PR comment:**
Posts/updates a single comment (sentinel: `<!-- ci-test-results -->`) via `peter-evans/find-comment@v3` + `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v4`. Shows a results table and coverage breakdown. The comment is updated (not duplicated) on every push.

**Failure:** The job fails at the end if either test step had a non-zero exit code.

---

### 3. `security-performance.yml` — Security & Performance

**Trigger:** PR opened/synchronized/reopened/ready-for-review targeting `main`
**Skip condition:** Draft PRs
**Concurrency:** One run per PR, cancels in-progress runs

Four jobs run; the last consolidates results into a PR comment.

#### Job 1 — Secret Detection (timeout: 2m, BLOCKING)

- Uses `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2` with config from `.gitleaks.toml`
- Checks out with `fetch-depth: 0` (full git history, so secrets in prior commits on the branch are caught)
- Failure here blocks the PR

#### Job 2 — Security Scan (timeout: 3m, BLOCKING on critical)

- Runs Semgrep (`semgrep/semgrep-action@v1`) with:
  - Community rulesets: `p/security-audit`, `p/javascript`, `p/react`, `p/nodejs`
  - Custom rules from `.semgrep.yml` (10 rules covering weak hashes, hardcoded secrets, XSS, SQLi, insecure cookies, Math.random in crypto contexts, sensitive localStorage usage)
- Generates SARIF output uploaded to GitHub Security tab (`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`)
- `continue-on-error: true` on the Semgrep step so SARIF upload always runs; a separate step then explicitly fails if Semgrep's outcome was failure

#### Job 3 — Bundle Size (timeout: 5m, NON-BLOCKING)

- Builds the Vite app, measures total JS and CSS sizes in `client/dist/assets/`
- Limits: JS ≤ 600 KB, CSS ≤ 80 KB
- Emits warnings but does NOT fail the workflow

#### Job 4 — Generate Report (`needs: [secret-detection, security-scan, bundle-size]`, `if: always()`)

- Consolidates all results into a PR comment (sentinel: `<!-- ci-security-report -->`)
- **Fails this job** if secret-detection or security-scan result is `failure`, making the overall workflow fail

---

### 4. `dependency-review.yml` — Dependency Review

**Trigger:** Any PR targeting `main` (no draft filter — runs on all PRs including drafts)
**Permissions:** `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`

Uses GitHub's official `actions/dependency-review-action@v4`:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Fail on severity | `high` |
| Vulnerability check | enabled |
| License check | enabled |
| Allowed licenses | MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC, 0BSD |
| OpenSSF scorecard warning | level 3 and below |
| PR comment | always |

Posts a summary directly to the PR. Fails the workflow on any high/critical CVE in added/changed dependencies.

---

### 5. `docker-validation.yml` — Docker Validation

**Trigger:** PR targeting `main`, but **only when these paths change:**
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose*.yml`
- `.dockerignore`

**Skip condition:** Draft PRs
**Concurrency:** One run per PR, cancels in-progress runs
**Timeout:** 15 minutes

**Build and validation sequence:**
1. `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`
2. `docker build --build-arg VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=ci-dummy-key --tag kanban-app:ci-test .`
3. Create isolated Docker network `kanban-test-net`
4. Start `postgres:17-alpine` on the network
5. Wait for `pg_isready` inside the container
6. Create `app_user` in the test database
7. Start the app container with `-p 3000` (no fixed host port — compliant with Coolify constraint)
8. Retrieve dynamic port: `docker port test-app 3000 | cut -d: -f2`
9. Poll `GET /api/health` up to 30 times (3s intervals) — fails if never healthy
10. Cleanup (`if: always()`) — stops and removes both containers and the network

**Why no fixed port?** The `docker-compose.yml` must not have fixed host port mappings to stay compatible with Coolify's routing. This workflow mirrors that constraint.

---

### 6. `auto-merge.yml` — Auto Merge

**Trigger:** `workflow_run` completed for any of: `PR Validation`, `Security & Performance`, `Dependency Review`, `Docker Validation`

This means auto-merge is re-evaluated every time any of the four upstream workflows finishes.

**Permissions:** `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `checks: read`

**Logic (runs only if triggering workflow succeeded):**

```
1. Find open PR for the branch targeting main
   - Skip: no PR found
   - Skip: PR is a draft
   - Skip: PR has conflicts (mergeable == CONFLICTING)

2. Check all 5 required checks via `gh pr checks`:
   - "Quick Checks"
   - "Database & API Tests"
   - "Secret Detection"
   - "Security Scan"
   - "Review Dependencies for Vulnerabilities"

3. If all 5 are SUCCESS:
   - gh pr merge <number> --squash --auto
   - Post confirmation comment on PR

4. Otherwise: exit silently (will re-evaluate on next workflow_run)
```

**Note:** "Build & Validate Docker Image" is NOT in the required checks list. Docker Validation only runs when Docker-related files change, so it would block auto-merge on unrelated PRs if included.

## Supporting Config Files

### `.gitleaks.toml`

Global allowlist covers:
- **Paths:** `*.md`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `server/tests/`, `.env.example`
- **Regexes:** test/placeholder/example/dummy/ci prefixed values, `localhost` URLs, CI postgres connection strings, `${{ ... }}` GitHub Actions expressions

Three custom rules with allowlists:
- `generic-api-key` — detects `api_key = "..."` patterns
- `jwt-better-auth-secret` — detects `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET = "..."` patterns
- `database-url-with-credentials` — detects non-localhost `postgres://user:pass@host` patterns

### `.semgrep.yml`

10 custom security rules for JavaScript:

| Rule ID | Severity | CWE |
|---------|----------|-----|
| `weak-hash-md5` | WARNING | CWE-327 |
| `weak-hash-sha1` | WARNING | CWE-327 |
| `hardcoded-secret-assignment` | ERROR | CWE-798 |
| `insecure-cookie-secure-false` | WARNING | CWE-614 |
| `insecure-cookie-httponly-false` | WARNING | CWE-1004 |
| `sql-injection-string-concat` | ERROR | CWE-89 |
| `xss-innerhtml` | WARNING | CWE-79 |
| `xss-dangerously-set-inner-html` | WARNING | CWE-79 |
| `insecure-math-random-security` | ERROR | CWE-338 |
| `sensitive-data-localstorage-password` | ERROR | CWE-312 |

### `.semgrepignore`

Excludes from Semgrep scans: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `client/dist/`, `server/tests/`, `*.test.*`, `server/drizzle/`, `coverage/`

---

## Required Checks for Auto-Merge

Only these 5 check names must all be `SUCCESS`:

| Check Name | Source Workflow | Job |
|------------|----------------|-----|
| Quick Checks | PR Validation | `quick-checks` |
| Database & API Tests | PR Validation | `db-and-api-tests` |
| Secret Detection | Security & Performance | `secret-detection` |
| Security Scan | Security & Performance | `security-scan` |
| Review Dependencies for Vulnerabilities | Dependency Review | `dependency-review` |

Docker Validation (`Build & Validate Docker Image`) is intentionally excluded — it only runs on Docker-related file changes and would block unrelated PRs.

---

## Environment Variables Used in CI

| Variable | Value in CI | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `ci-dummy-key` | Required by Vite build (client-side crypto) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://app_user:app_password@localhost:5432/kanban_test` | Non-superuser connection (RLS enforced) |
| `ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/kanban_test` | Superuser connection (migrations, RLS setup) |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | `ci-secret-for-better-auth-minimum-32-chars` | Must be 32+ chars — shorter values crash the auth module |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Auth base URL |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Injected by GitHub | Used by gitleaks, auto-merge, dependency review |

---

## PR Comment Sentinels

Each workflow that posts PR comments uses an HTML comment as a sentinel so the comment is updated in-place rather than duplicated on every push:

| Sentinel | Workflow |
|----------|---------|
| `<!-- ci-test-results -->` | PR Validation |
| `<!-- ci-security-report -->` | Security & Performance |

Dependency Review uses the built-in comment feature of `actions/dependency-review-action` (no custom sentinel needed).

---

## Concurrency Behaviour

Three workflows use `cancel-in-progress: true` grouped by PR number:
- `pr-validation-<PR_NUMBER>`
- `security-performance-<PR_NUMBER>`
- `docker-validation-<PR_NUMBER>`

This means pushing a new commit to a PR while CI is running immediately cancels the in-progress run and starts a fresh one. `dependency-review.yml` relies on the GitHub Action's own concurrency handling.
